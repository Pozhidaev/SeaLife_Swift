Every creature can do one thing per turn:
Fish can move or reproduce itself one time in X turns (X - kFishReproductionPeriod)
Orca can move or reproduce itself one time in X turns (X - kOrcaReproductionPeriod), or eat fish. If Orca doesn't eat more then Y turns it dies (Y - kOrcaAllowedHungerPoins) 
Concrete values are in Constants.h file

Creatures turns are performed by timers
